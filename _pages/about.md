ONS is responsible for the development and collection of UK data for the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDG) global indicators and for reporting UK progress towards them.

This website is for disseminating UK SDG indicator data. We are at an Alpha stage in development, so the site is still 'work in progress'.

We initially based the UK website on the [US SDG reporting platform](https://sdg.data.gov/) and continue to collaborate with the US on further developing our websites. The UK site has been developed by the [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/).  

Other countries wishing to reuse the UK or US SDG reporting platforms are welcome to do so for free. Our [Guidance page](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/guidance/) highlights key information on how to do this, linking to detailed technical instructions available in our [wiki pages](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/sdg-indicators/wiki). The US have also produced various [training materials](https://sdg.data.gov/training/). The  [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) can also provide guidance and support through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/).

If you have any feedback on this website or UK SDG data then please contact us at <a href="mailto:sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk">sustainabledevelopment@ons.gov.uk</a>. The answers to some frequently asked questions can be found in our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/faq.md %}).
