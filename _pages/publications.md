## Publications

### All goals

**[Response to our consulation on the approach to measuring and reporting SDGs in the UK, 11 December 2017](https://consultations.ons.gov.uk/sustainable-development-goals/ons-approach-to-measuring-reporting-sdgs-in-the-uk/)**  
We ran a public consultation between 29 June and 29 September 2017 to look at our approach to reporting and how we prioritise areas for developing data for the SDG indicators. We received 111 responses from a wide variety of sectors. This report is our response to your feedback.

**[Sustainable Development Goals: progress and possibilities, 9 November 2017](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/sustainabledevelopmentgoalstakingstockprogressandpossibilities/november2017)**  
This is our first report on the progress weâ€™ve made towards measuring the global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators in the UK. It looks at the work we have been doing to be able to measure our progress and explains how we are already sharing the data we have.

### Goal 3 Good health and well-being

**[UK drops in European child mortality rankings, 13 October 2017](https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-drops-in-european-child-mortality-rankings/)**  
This short story looks at the two indicators (under five and neonatal mortality) under Target 3.2, showing that although the UK has seen improvements over the last forty years, the rate of improvement has slowed compared with some other EU countries.

### Goal 7 Affordable and clean energy

**[Renewable Energy in the UK, 22 November 2017](https://www.slideshare.net/statisticsONS/renewable-energy-in-the-uk)**  
This SlideShare takes a look at renewable energy consumption in the UK which is under Target 7.2. It highlights that while overall energy consumption has gone down, the proportion of energy from renewable sources has risen. It shows that not all renewables are emission free and some can create pollutants, burning wood is used as an example. The UK is setting out plans to meet international commitments to reducing emissions of air pollutants.
